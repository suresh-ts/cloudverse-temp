Replit prompt (surgical, do this now)

Prompt: Replace the 3 empty micro-visual grids in “How CloudVerse™ works” with real-looking micro-preview cards (not skeleton placeholders).

In the Home “How CloudVerse™ works” section:

Find the three bottom boxes under Connect / Normalize / Automate.

Remove the current 3x3 empty square grids entirely.

Replace them with a new reusable component:

components/home/MicroPreview.tsx

Props: variant: "connect" | "normalize" | "automate"

Visual style (AIX premium):

Container: rounded-2xl border border-white/10 bg-white/[0.04]

Inner shadow: subtle, not heavy

Height: h-[170px] sm:h-[180px]

Padding: p-4 sm:p-5

Add a small top label inside each card: text-[11px] tracking-[0.18em] text-white/50 uppercase

Micro-preview content per variant:

Variant: connect

Top label: Typical setup

Row of provider chips (pill badges): AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI + “+ more”

A 3-line status list with tiny dots:

“Read-only access”

“Scoped roles”

“Usage + billing signals”

Bottom-right tiny tag: “Connections”

Variant: normalize

Top label: Normalized dimensions

A 2-column mini mapping table (no real data):

cost_center → Team

env → Environment

app → Product

Row of dimension chips: Team, Product, Env, Owner

Bottom-right tiny tag: “Cost model”

Variant: automate

Top label: Automation queue

A list of 3 items with small “impact” pills:

“Idle compute cleanup” (High)

“Commitment right-size” (Medium)

“Storage tiering” (Low)

A small “Anomaly detected” badge with a tiny sparkline line beneath it (CSS-only or simple div bars)

Bottom-right tiny tag: “Automation”

Layout improvements:

Reduce spacing so the cards feel integrated with the step content:

Use mt-6 on desktop, mt-5 on mobile.

Ensure cards align evenly and never overflow at smaller widths.

Remove any skeleton loading styles from these cards. They should look “finished” even with mock data.

Acceptance check

The bottom area no longer looks empty or like placeholders.

At a glance, each card communicates the step (connect/normalize/automate).

Looks good on mobile: cards stack cleanly and keep height under control.
