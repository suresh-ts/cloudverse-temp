Task 0 — Guardrails

Do not change the locked Home hero headline/subhead/CTAs.

Keep dark mode aesthetic and existing navbar.

Only refactor the How CloudVerse works section + supporting layout tokens needed so it looks good at all breakpoints.

Task 1 — Layout tokens (global consistency)

Create shared layout constants:

container: mx-auto w-full max-w-7xl px-6 sm:px-8

Section vertical padding standard:

default sections: py-16 sm:py-20

hero: keep as-is

Ensure every major section uses the same container width. Remove any hardcoded widths that cause “center drift” on resize.

Task 2 — Replace “How CloudVerse works” with premium timeline

Replace the existing plain block with a new component:

components/home/HowItWorks.tsx

Visual style:

Background: subtle elevated panel: rounded-3xl border border-white/10 bg-white/[0.03]

Add soft inner glow: shadow-[0_0_0_1px_rgba(255,255,255,0.06),0_30px_80px_rgba(0,0,0,0.55)]

Title + subhead centered

Structure:

Desktop (lg+): 3 cards in a row (grid-cols-3)

Tablet/mobile: stacked (grid-cols-1) with a left timeline rail

Add a timeline cue:

Desktop: thin line behind cards (horizontal)

Mobile: left vertical rail with numbered dots

Use simple IntersectionObserver to animate “active step” (no heavy animation libs required)

Each step is a “card” with:

Number pill: 01 / 02 / 03

Title

One sentence

Exactly 2 bullets

A “micro visual tile” on the right (desktop) or below (mobile): a small frosted rectangle with tiny blocks, labeled.

Copy (final for this section):

Section title: How CloudVerse™ works

Subtitle: Connect once. Normalize everything. Automate what you can.

Step 01 — Connect

Body: Read-only connections across clouds, data, and AI platforms.

Bullets:

Scoped access and tenant isolation

Imports billing + usage signals

Micro visual label: “Connections”

Step 02 — Normalize

Body: A unified cost model for accounts, tags, owners, services, and products.

Bullets:

Tag normalization + governance

Allocation-ready dimensions

Micro visual label: “Cost model”

Step 03 — Automate

Body: Recommendations and actions driven by 40+ ML models, with guardrails.

Bullets:

Detect + predict anomalies

Track realized savings

Micro visual label: “Automation”

Task 3 — Make the section “feel premium” (subtle motion)

Add a very subtle animated gradient wash behind the section panel (not the whole page):

Use a pseudo-element div positioned absolute, blurred, opacity 20–30%.

Animate slowly with CSS keyframes (8–12s) for slight movement.

Keep motion minimal (Apple-like). No flashy parallax.

Task 4 — Responsiveness + resize hardening (must fix)

Ensure text never gets cramped:

Heading clamp:

text-3xl sm:text-4xl lg:text-5xl

Body:

text-base sm:text-lg text-white/70 leading-relaxed

Ensure cards maintain spacing on mid widths:

Use: gap-6 lg:gap-8

Card padding: p-6 sm:p-7

Ensure hero + navbar alignment stays consistent with the same container width.

Task 5 — Wire behavior (don’t invent routes)

Keep all existing links intact.

For “Platform / Solutions / Integrations / Security / Resources / Pricing / Company”:

Use the current project route map and existing hrefs in code.

Do not create placeholder routes.

If any link currently points nowhere, route it to the matching existing page in the repo (scan app/ routes).

Run through Home → Platform → Integrations → Pricing to verify no broken navigation.

Deliverables checklist

 New HowItWorks section looks premium and not plain

 Looks correct on mobile, tablet, desktop

 No weird left/right empty space on resize

 Timeline active step animates subtly on scroll

 No broken nav links
