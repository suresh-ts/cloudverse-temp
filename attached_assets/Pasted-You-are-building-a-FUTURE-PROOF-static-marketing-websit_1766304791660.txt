You are building a FUTURE-PROOF static marketing website for https://cloudverse.ai with Apple Developer aesthetics, but ready for interactive features + user tracking tomorrow.

PRIMARY GOALS
1) Rebuild cloudverse.ai as a high-performance static site (Apple Developer theme).
2) Import (download) all images used on cloudverse.ai pages into this repo under /public/assets/cloudverse-import/ and serve locally (no hotlinking).
3) Preserve hyperlinks (internal + external) intentionally:
   - Recreate nav/footer links cleanly
   - Extract all <a href> links into a links-manifest.json for validation so nothing is lost
4) Add a tracking abstraction today (vendor-agnostic) and instrument links/CTAs via data attributes.
5) Add interactivity via Astro Islands only where needed (pricing toggle, integrations filter, feature tabs, demo form).

STACK (DO THIS EXACTLY)
- Astro (latest)
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Node 20
- Use Astro Islands Architecture
- Do NOT add React globally. Only use React/Svelte components for specific interactive islands if needed.

PAGES / ROUTES (CREATE THESE)
- /                      (Home)
- /platform              (Platform Overview)
- /solutions             (Solutions by persona)
- /integrations          (Integrations)
- /pricing               (Pricing)
- /security              (Security & Compliance)
- /company               (Company / About)
- /resources             (Resources / Blog list placeholder)
- /contact               (Contact)
- /legal/terms           (Terms – placeholder)
- /legal/privacy         (Privacy – placeholder)

CRITICAL: URL STABILITY
- Keep these existing canonical paths working:
  /platform
  /integrations
  /pricing
  /about-us  -> redirect to /company (create a static redirect page)
  /blog      -> redirect to /resources (create a static redirect page)
  /partners  -> redirect to /company (or /solutions if appropriate; create redirect page)
Do NOT break deep links. Add minimal redirect pages if needed.

========================================================
TASK A — BOOTSTRAP PROJECT
1) Initialize Astro + Tailwind + TypeScript.
2) Create a clean design system following Apple Developer vibe:
   - Typography: Inter (use @fontsource/inter or Google font import)
   - Sizes: H1 56/60, H2 40/46, H3 28/34, Body 17/28, Caption 13/18
   - Layout: max-w-[1200px], generous whitespace, section padding 96/64/48
   - Colors: white + offwhite surfaces, near-black text, ONE accent color (indigo/blue)
   - Visual style: subtle hairline borders, minimal shadows, no loud gradients
3) Build shared layout components:
   - src/components/SiteNav.astro
   - src/components/Footer.astro
   - src/components/Section.astro
   - src/components/Button.astro (primary/secondary/tertiary)
   - src/components/Card.astro
   - src/components/Badge.astro
   - src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro

SiteNav must include these top links:
Platform, Solutions, Integrations, Customers (placeholder), Security, Resources, Pricing, Company, Contact
Include “Book a demo” as primary CTA and “Sign in” as secondary link.
(All links must be real routes or safe placeholders.)

========================================================
TASK B — TRACKING FOUNDATION (VENDOR-AGNOSTIC)
Create:
- src/lib/track.ts
  export type TrackPayload = Record<string, any>
  export function track(event: string, payload?: TrackPayload): void
Implementation today:
- Store a queue in window.__cvTrackQueue
- console.log in dev
- Provide adapters (stubs) for GA4 and PostHog but do not require them.

Create:
- src/components/TrackProvider.astro
This loads a tiny client script (no heavy libs) that:
- Tracks page_view on navigation/load
- Tracks scroll_depth at 25/50/75/100
- Tracks click events for elements with:
  data-track="event_name"
  data-track-meta='{"key":"value"}' (optional JSON)

Instrumentation requirements:
- Every primary CTA button/link must have data-track:
  - cta_demo
  - cta_contact
  - cta_watch_tour
- Nav links:
  - nav_platform, nav_solutions, nav_integrations, nav_pricing, nav_security, nav_company, nav_resources
- Pricing interactions:
  - pricing_toggle_billing
  - pricing_select_plan
- Integrations:
  - integrations_filter_change
  - integrations_card_click
- Contact form:
  - contact_submit

IMPORTANT: Tracking must never break links. Links must work with JS disabled.

========================================================
TASK C — INTERACTIVE ISLANDS (MINIMAL JS)
Use Astro Islands ONLY for:
1) Pricing billing toggle (Monthly/Annual) and plan highlight
2) Integrations filter (All / Cloud / Data / AI / Security / SaaS)
3) Platform feature tabs (Visibility / Allocation / Optimization / Governance / FinOps for AI)
4) Contact form validation (lightweight)
All other UI stays static.

Implementation guidance:
- Prefer vanilla TS for islands.
- If you need a framework, use React ONLY for the specific island component and hydrate with client:idle.
Do NOT create a SPA.

========================================================
TASK D — ASSET IMPORTER (DOWNLOAD ALL IMAGES LOCALLY)
Create Node script:
- scripts/import-cloudverse-assets.mjs

It must:
1) Crawl these pages:
   https://cloudverse.ai/
   https://cloudverse.ai/platform
   https://cloudverse.ai/integrations
   https://cloudverse.ai/pricing
   https://cloudverse.ai/about-us
   https://cloudverse.ai/partners
   https://cloudverse.ai/blog
2) From each fetched HTML, extract ALL image references from:
   - <img src="...">
   - <source srcset="...">
   - <link rel="preload" as="image" href="...">
   - inline styles background-image: url(...)
   - any URL containing "/images/" or "/_next/image"
3) Handle Next.js image optimizer URLs:
   - If URL is "/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2F...&w=..." then decode the url param to get the original "/images/..." path.
   - Attempt direct download of decoded "/images/..." first.
   - If that fails, fallback to downloading the original "/_next/image?...".
4) Save all assets to:
   public/assets/cloudverse-import/<path>
   Example:
   /images/aboutUs/iso.png
   -> public/assets/cloudverse-import/images/aboutUs/iso.png
5) Create a manifest:
   public/assets/cloudverse-import/manifest.json
   Format:
   {
     "<originalUrl>": "/assets/cloudverse-import/....",
     ...
   }
Also store per-page found assets:
   public/assets/cloudverse-import/manifest.byPage.json

Resilience:
- Retry failed downloads (max 3)
- Skip duplicates by filename+size or content hash
- Support svg, png, jpg, jpeg, webp, gif
- Log a clear summary: total found, downloaded, failed

Constraints:
- Use Node fetch (undici) + fs/promises only. No puppeteer.

========================================================
TASK E — HYPERLINK PRESERVATION + VALIDATION
Extend the crawler to also extract ALL hyperlinks from:
- <a href="..."> on each crawled page

Create:
- public/assets/cloudverse-import/links-manifest.json
Format:
[
  {
    "source": "https://cloudverse.ai/platform",
    "text": "Explore Integrations",
    "href": "/integrations"
  },
  ...
]

Then create a validation script:
- scripts/validate-links.mjs
It must:
- Read links-manifest.json
- Validate internal links resolve to one of the created routes or redirect pages
- Output warnings for:
  - missing internal route
  - malformed href
  - empty href
- Do NOT fail build for external links, only report.

Add npm script: "validate:links": node scripts/validate-links.mjs

========================================================
TASK F — APPLE DEVELOPER THEME PAGES (COPY + STRUCTURE)
Create pages using BaseLayout + components and local images.

HOME PAGE (/)
Structure:
1) Hero:
   - H1: "Cloud financial management for modern engineering."
   - Subhead: "Real-time visibility, allocation, and AI-driven optimization across AWS, Azure, and GCP—built for Finance and Engineering."
   - Buttons: Book a demo (primary), Watch 90-second tour (secondary)
   - Hero screenshot using imported asset if available; otherwise placeholder that is easy to swap
2) Trusted by (minimal logo strip)
3) 3 pillars:
   - Visibility
   - Allocation
   - Optimization
4) How it works (Connect / Normalize / Act)
5) 3 feature bands (each with screenshot)
6) Outcomes/Proof strip (minimal, not hype)
7) Security strip (ISO 27001 + SOC 2 Type II)
8) Final CTA

PLATFORM (/platform)
- Hero + screenshot
- Feature tabs island (Visibility/Allocation/Optimization/Governance/FinOps for AI)
- Simple architecture strip (Connect → Normalize → Analyze → Recommend → Report)
- CTA

SOLUTIONS (/solutions)
- Cards by persona: Finance, Engineering, CIO/IT
- Each has: pains, what CloudVerse does, 2–3 bullet outcomes, CTA

INTEGRATIONS (/integrations)
- Filterable grid island
- Each card: logo, name, short line, badges (Cloud/Data/AI/SaaS)
- CTA to Book demo
- Use imported logos where possible; otherwise placeholder icons

PRICING (/pricing)
- Pricing toggle island (monthly/annual display only; no payments)
- 3 tiers (Starter/Professional/Enterprise) with calm Apple styling
- Clean “What’s included”
- CTA to talk to sales

SECURITY (/security)
- Compliance badges + clear explanation
- RBAC, encryption, least privilege, audit logs
- Responsible disclosure contact

COMPANY (/company)
- Mission + story
- Leadership section (use imported headshot assets if available)
- Locations/contact

RESOURCES (/resources)
- Blog list placeholder (3–6 cards)
- Do not scrape full blog content; keep it simple

CONTACT (/contact)
- Clean form: name, email, company, message
- Client validation island
- On submit: track("contact_submit") and show success message (no backend required yet)

REDIRECT PAGES
- /about-us (redirect to /company)
- /blog (redirect to /resources)
- /partners (redirect to /company or /solutions)
Implement as simple static pages with meta refresh + link.

COPY RULES
- Apple Developer tone: short, specific, calm
- Avoid: "ultimate", "best-in-class", "revolutionary"
- Use clear statements and outcomes
- Keep content consistent across pages; no repetition blocks

========================================================
TASK G — SEO + PERFORMANCE
- Add sensible meta tags per page (title/description)
- OpenGraph defaults
- Ensure:
  - No global JS bundle
  - Only islands load JS
  - Images lazy-loaded below fold
  - Use local assets in /public
- Provide a simple sitemap.xml and robots.txt

========================================================
TASK H — NPM SCRIPTS
Add:
- "dev": "astro dev"
- "build": "astro build"
- "preview": "astro preview"
- "import:assets": "node scripts/import-cloudverse-assets.mjs"
- "validate:links": "node scripts/validate-links.mjs"

========================================================
DELIVERABLE CHECKLIST
- Astro site runs and builds successfully
- All pages exist and are linked from nav/footer
- Image importer downloads assets and creates manifest files
- Site references local images where available
- Links manifest created; validate-links reports missing internal links
- Tracking works via data attributes; links never break if JS is off
- Interactive islands exist only where required
- Apple Developer visual theme applied consistently
