Add “Private deployment” and “Air-gapped” support to BOTH Home and Security pages, without making the hero wordy and without changing overall layout.

DO NOT change navigation, typography system, spacing tokens, or page structure.
Only insert the minimum copy in the correct sections.

============================================================
TASK 1 — HOME PAGE (MINIMAL ADD)
Find the “Security and compliance, built in.” trust section on Home.

Add ONE additional line of body copy (muted, calm), directly under the existing description:

“Private deployment options—including air-gapped environments—available for regulated enterprises.”

Rules:
- One sentence only
- Keep it muted (text-muted), not a headline
- Do not add new cards, icons, or sections

============================================================
TASK 2 — SECURITY PAGE (STRUCTURED ADD)
On /security:

A) CORE CONTROLS LIST
Add a new control row (same style as others):

Title: Private & air-gapped deployment
Description: Deployment options for regulated environments, including private and air-gapped setups.

B) ADD A “DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS” BLOCK
Add a compact section after “Core security controls” and before “Compliance alignment”.

Section title: Deployment options
Bullets:
- Private deployment (customer-controlled environment)
- Air-gapped deployment options for regulated environments
- Enterprise onboarding and security review support

Style:
- Apple settings feel
- Tight spacing
- Subtle dividers (border-white/10)
- No icons

============================================================
GUARDRAILS
- Do not overclaim certifications
- Do not mention specific regulators
- Do not add long paragraphs
- Keep wording exactly as provided
- Treat Home + Security as locked after the change

============================================================
DELIVERABLE
- Home trust section now includes private/air-gapped line (minimal)
- Security page includes private/air-gapped in core controls + deployment options block
- Layout remains clean and consistent
