We have an Astro + Tailwind + TypeScript marketing site for CloudVerse™. It looks clean but has too much vertical spacing and still feels generic. I want you to apply a final Apple Developer–style polish: rewrite homepage copy word-for-word (provided below), fix spacing tokens globally, remove fake “trusted by” logos, replace the hero placeholder with a neutral skeleton (until real screenshot is added), and redesign the Platform page to match the same style. CloudVerse is trademarked: always render “CloudVerse™” in branding contexts.

DO NOT add heavy animations, do NOT add global React, and do NOT add extra sections. Keep the site fast and static-first. Use Astro Islands only where needed (Platform tabs, Integrations filter, Pricing toggle, Contact validation).

TASK 0 — Add Tailwind tokens (Typography + Spacing) and apply them
- Update tailwind.config to include:
  font sizes: cv-h1, cv-h2, cv-h3, cv-body, cv-cap
  spacing: cv-sec-xl (88px), cv-sec-lg (64px), cv-sec-md (44px)
  colors: cv-ink, cv-muted, cv-line, cv-surface, cv-surface2
  radius: cv (20px)
  shadow: cv-card
- Update BaseLayout + global styles so:
  container = mx-auto max-w-[1200px] px-6
  hero sections use py-cv-sec-xl
  primary sections use py-cv-sec-lg
  utility strips use py-cv-sec-md
- Remove any min-h-screen on homepage sections.
- Replace overly large py-24/py-32 usage with the new tokens.

TASK 1 — Homepage: replace ALL copy with final text and fix layout spacing
- Apply this EXACT homepage copy:
  Header: CloudVerse™ and nav items (Platform, Solutions, Integrations, Security, Resources, Pricing, Company, Sign in, Book a demo)
  Hero:
    H1: Cloud financial management for modern engineering.
    Subhead: Real-time visibility, allocation, and AI-driven optimization across AWS, Azure, and GCP—built for Finance and Engineering.
    Buttons: Book a demo (primary), Watch 90-second tour (secondary)
    Small trust line: ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II certified.
  Trusted strip:
    Eyebrow: TRUSTED BY TEAMS WHO RUN COMPLEX CLOUDS
    Line: Built for multi-account, multi-org environments—where accountability matters.
  Pillars section:
    Title: A single platform for visibility, accountability, and savings.
    Cards:
      Visibility: A real-time view of spend across providers, accounts, regions, and services—down to the resource when you need it.
      Allocation: Showback and chargeback with rules, shared cost pools, and audit-ready exports that Finance can trust.
      Optimization: Recommendations prioritized by impact, effort, and risk—so Engineering can act with confidence.
  How it works (3 steps only):
    Title: How CloudVerse™ works
    Subtitle: Connect your clouds, normalize billing data, and take action—without slowing down delivery.
    Step 1 Connect: Read-only connections with scoped permissions.
    Step 2 Normalize: Unified accounts, tags, services, and cost models across providers.
    Step 3 Act: Build views, allocate costs, and track realized savings over time.
  Feature bands:
    1) Eyebrow: DYNAMIC PERSPECTIVES
       Title: Cost views that match how your business runs.
       Body: Create stakeholder-ready views by product, environment, team, region, service, or custom dimensions. Drill down from portfolio to resource without rebuilding dashboards.
       Link: Explore Platform →
    2) Eyebrow: ALLOCATION
       Title: Chargeback that holds up under scrutiny.
       Body: Allocate shared costs, map spend to business units, and export clear ledgers for review. Keep Finance and Engineering aligned on a single source of truth.
       Link: Explore Allocation →
    3) Eyebrow: OPTIMIZATION
       Title: Actions engineers will actually take.
       Body: Identify waste, rightsize safely, and prioritize the changes that move the bill. Track savings as “realized,” not just estimated.
       Link: Explore Optimization →
  Security strip:
    Title: Security and compliance, built in.
    Body: CloudVerse™ is designed for enterprise security—from access controls to auditability.

  Final CTA:
    Title: See CloudVerse™ on your data.
    Body: Book a demo and we’ll walk through your spend structure, allocation needs, and the fastest path to measurable savings.
    Buttons: Book a demo, Contact sales
  Footer one-liner:
    CloudVerse™ helps Finance and Engineering teams understand, allocate, and optimize multi-cloud spend.

- Remove any fake text-logo customer names (Acme Corp etc). Use the trust strip only.
- Replace the hero “Dashboard Screenshot Placeholder” with a neutral skeleton UI (no placeholder text).
- Fix vertical spacing by using the new section spacing tokens.

TASK 2 — Platform page: design + build to match the homepage style
Create /platform with this layout and copy:

Hero:
  H1: Control cloud spend at every layer.
  Subhead: CloudVerse™ brings real-time visibility, allocation, and optimization together—so Finance and Engineering can operate from the same truth.
  Buttons: Book a demo, Explore integrations
  Right panel: same product frame as homepage (skeleton if no real screenshot)

Modules grid:
  Title: What you get with CloudVerse™
  6 cards:
    Visibility & Reporting
    Dynamic Perspectives
    Allocation
    Optimization
    Governance
    FinOps for AI
  Each card has a 1-line description and a “Learn more →” anchor link.

Interactive feature tabs (Astro island, lightweight TS):
  Tabs: Visibility, Allocation, Optimization, Governance, FinOps for AI
  Each tab shows:
    Title + paragraph + 3 bullets + right-side screenshot skeleton
  Default tab: Visibility

Architecture strip:
  Title: How it fits into your workflow
  Row: Connect → Normalize → Analyze → Recommend → Report

Security strip:
  Reuse the same security strip component.

Final CTA:
  Title: Get a platform view of your cloud economics.
  Body: We’ll map your org structure, allocation needs, and optimization priorities.
  Buttons: Book a demo, Contact sales

TASK 3 — Components: enforce Apple Developer consistency
- Create/ensure shared components:
  Section, Button, Card, Badge, FeatureBand, SecurityStrip, CTA
- Buttons:
  Primary: filled, pill, subtle shadow
  Secondary: outline
  Tertiary: text link + chevron
- Cards: border hairline + light shadow (cv-card), radius cv

TASK 4 — Tracking stays intact (do not break links)
- Ensure all nav and CTA links work without JS.
- Keep data-track attributes in place if present.
- Add data-track to new CTAs: cta_demo, cta_watch_tour, cta_contact

DELIVERABLE:
- Homepage and Platform page updated with final copy
- Reduced vertical whitespace using spacing tokens
- Hero placeholder replaced with skeleton UI
- No fake customer logos
- CloudVerse™ displayed correctly in branding
- Clean, consistent Apple Developer aesthetic
