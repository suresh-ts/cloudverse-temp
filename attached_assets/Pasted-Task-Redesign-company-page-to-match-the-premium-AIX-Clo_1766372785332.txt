Task: Redesign /company page to match the premium AIX/CloudVerse™ style (wider layout, better hierarchy, responsive).

1) Page structure + layout

Update app/company/page.tsx (or pages/company.tsx, whichever exists).

Wrap all content in:

Outer: bg-black text-white

Main container: max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 sm:px-8

Replace the current center-stacked narrow layout with sections using grid:

For each section: grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-12 gap-8 lg:gap-12

Title column: lg:col-span-4

Content column: lg:col-span-8

2) Hero (fix the “tiny headline” problem)

Hero should be visually strong and aligned with other pages:

Eyebrow: CLOUDVERSE™

H1: About CloudVerse™

Subhead: one calm sentence (no long paragraph)

Add a subtle background: radial-gradient + faint grid (reuse the same motion/hero background component if present).

Hero spacing:

pt-16 sm:pt-20

pb-10 sm:pb-12

Typography:

H1: text-4xl sm:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-semibold tracking-tight

Subhead: text-base sm:text-lg text-white/70 max-w-2xl

3) Remove the “too many divider lines”

Delete full-width horizontal rules between every section.

Use spacing instead:

Section wrapper: py-12 sm:py-16

Only keep one subtle divider before the final CTA:

border-t border-white/10

4) Content redesign (make it feel premium, not “blog text”)

Create these sections:

Section A — Mission

Left column:

Title: “Mission”

One-line description
Right column:

A single large card with 2–3 lines:

Card style: rounded-2xl border border-white/10 bg-white/[0.04] p-6 sm:p-8

Section B — What we do (turn bullets into 4 cards)

Right column should be a card grid:

grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4
Cards (4):

Unified visibility

Allocation & chargeback

Anomalies (detected + predicted)

Automation (40+ ML models + guardrails)
Each card:

Title: text-white font-medium

Body: text-white/70 text-sm leading-relaxed

Section C — How we work (3-step row, stronger)

Use 3 compact “principle cards”:

“Connect once”

“Normalize everything”

“Automate with guardrails”
Add a short line under each. Same card style.

Section D — Trust & security (THIS must not look tiny)

Right column: 4 cards grid:

Enterprise access controls

Audit-ready logs & exports

Private deployment

Air-gapped option
Add a small “Standards” line under grid:

ISO 27001 • SOC 2 Type II (if you don’t want to claim certification yet, write “Aligned to ISO 27001 & SOC 2 controls” instead)

5) Final CTA band (make it look intentional)

Replace the current small “Get in touch” and repeated “See CloudVerse…” with ONE band:

Full-width inside container:

rounded-2xl border border-white/10 bg-gradient-to-b from-white/[0.06] to-white/[0.03] p-8 sm:p-10

Headline: “See CloudVerse™ on your data.”

Subhead: “We’ll map your spend structure and the fastest path to measurable savings.”

Buttons:

Primary: Book a demo

Secondary: Contact sales

6) Responsive requirements (must)

On mobile: everything becomes single-column, cards stack, padding reduces:

px-5

reduce py to py-10

Ensure nav doesn’t overlap hero: add pt offset if header is fixed.

Ensure text never looks “tiny centered” on large screens.

7) Replace any “Company page looks empty” symptoms

No centered micro-columns.

No repeated divider lines.

Use max-w-7xl and 2-column grids.

Acceptance checklist

At 1440px width: content spans properly and looks “designed”, not a thin column.

At 768px: cards wrap nicely, no weird gaps.

At 390px: no overflow, buttons stack cleanly.
