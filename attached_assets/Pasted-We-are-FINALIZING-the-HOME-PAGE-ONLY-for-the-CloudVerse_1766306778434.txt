We are FINALIZING the HOME PAGE ONLY for the CloudVerse marketing site.
DO NOT modify any other pages, routes, or components except those used by the Home page.

OBJECTIVE
- Lock down the Home page with final copy, correct spacing, and Apple Developer aesthetics.
- Preserve performance (static-first).
- Do not touch Platform, Pricing, Integrations, or any other page yet.

LOCKED HERO (DO NOT CHANGE COPY)
Eyebrow: CloudVerse™
H1: Cloud financial management for modern enterprises.
Subhead: Real-time visibility, allocation, anomaly detection, and automated optimization across AWS, Azure, and GCP—built for Finance, Engineering, and platform teams in the AI era.
Primary CTA: Book a demo
Secondary CTA: Watch 90-second tour

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 1 — HERO SECTION (HOME PAGE ONLY)
- Ensure the Home hero uses the exact locked copy above.
- Place “CloudVerse™” as a small eyebrow above the H1 (branding context).
- Replace any “Dashboard Screenshot Placeholder” with a neutral product skeleton UI:
  - No placeholder text
  - Light surface (#F5F5F7)
  - Subtle rounded corners
- Hero layout:
  - Left: copy + CTAs
  - Right: product frame (skeleton)
- Hero section spacing:
  - Use py-cv-sec-xl
  - Remove min-h-screen or excessive padding
- CTAs:
  - Primary = filled button
  - Secondary = text button or outline
  - Add data-track="cta_demo" and data-track="cta_watch_tour"
  - Links must work without JS

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 2 — GLOBAL SPACING FIX (HOME PAGE SCOPE)
- Reduce excessive vertical spacing on Home page:
  - Replace py-24 / py-32 with py-cv-sec-lg
  - Replace large mb-16 / mb-20 with mb-10 or mb-8
  - Replace gap-24 with gap-12
- Do NOT alter spacing tokens globally yet—only adjust Home page usage.
- Goal: tighter, Apple-like rhythm (not airy SaaS landing page).

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 3 — TRUST STRIP (NO FAKE LOGOS)
Replace any fake customer logos with a calm trust strip:
- Eyebrow (small caps): BUILT FOR TEAMS WHO RUN COMPLEX CLOUDS
- Line: Automation-first FinOps with developer workflows—so savings don’t wait for month-end.
- Keep this section compact (py-cv-sec-md).

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 4 — THREE CORE PILLARS
Section title:
A single platform for visibility, accountability, and action.

Cards (3 only, no icons if possible):
1) Visibility
   A real-time view of spend across providers, accounts, regions, and services—down to the resource when you need it.
2) Allocation
   Showback and chargeback with rules, shared cost pools, and audit-ready exports Finance can trust.
3) Automation
   Recommendations powered by 40+ ML models—applied automatically with guardrails and tracked as realized savings.

Layout:
- Use a 3-column grid on desktop
- gap-10 or gap-12 max
- No heavy shadows

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 5 — HOW IT WORKS (3 STEPS ONLY)
Title:
How CloudVerse works

Subtitle:
Connect your clouds, normalize billing data, and automate what you can—without slowing down delivery.

Steps:
1) Connect
   Read-only connections with scoped permissions.
2) Normalize
   Unified taxonomy for accounts, tags, services, and cost models.
3) Automate
   Apply safe actions, route the rest to owners, and measure outcomes.

- Use horizontal layout on desktop, vertical on mobile
- Numbers should be visible and high-contrast
- Keep section compact (py-cv-sec-lg)

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 6 — FEATURE BANDS (DIFFERENTIATION)
Use the existing FeatureBand component if present.
Create exactly 3 bands, in this order:

Band 1

Title: Cost visibility where engineers work.
Body: Bring cost context into daily engineering workflows—before changes ship.
Link: Explore Developer FinOps →

Band 2
Eyebrow: AUTONOMOUS TAG ENGINE

Link: Explore Tag Engine →

Band 3
Eyebrow: ANOMALIES + RECOMMENDATIONS
Title: Detect spikes. Predict risk. Take action.
Body: Detected and predicted anomalies with recommendation paths—so teams can respond before the bill does.

Spacing:

------------------------------------------------------------
