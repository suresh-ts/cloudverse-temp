We are FINALIZING and LOCKING the PRICING page.
Route: /pricing

This page must feel:
- Enterprise-first
- Calm and confident
- Not salesy
- Not cluttered
- No gimmicks (no “Most Popular”, no fake savings)

IMPORTANT:
- Pricing values, tiers, and descriptions must be copied EXACTLY from the existing CloudVerse website.
- DO NOT invent prices, limits, or plan names.
- If something is unclear, keep copy neutral and defer to sales.

============================================================
BRANDING & TITLE
- document.title = "Pricing — CloudVerse™"
- Use CloudVerse™ ONLY in page title and first hero mention.
- Elsewhere use “CloudVerse”.

============================================================
PAGE STRUCTURE (LOCKED)

1) Hero (positioning, not numbers)
2) Pricing Plans (clean grid)
3) What’s included (capability list)
4) Usage & scale clarification
5) Enterprise & custom plans
6) FAQ
7) Final CTA

No other sections.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — HERO (POSITIONING, NOT PRICE-LED)

Eyebrow:
Pricing

H1:
Simple pricing that scales with you.

Subhead:
CloudVerse pricing is designed for enterprise environments—clear, predictable, and aligned to real usage.

Layout:
- Centered text
- max-w-[720px]
- py-cv-sec-lg
- No product visuals

============================================================
SECTION 2 — PRICING PLANS (COPY FROM EXISTING SITE)

IMPORTANT:
You must extract plan names, descriptions, and pricing from the current CloudVerse website.
Do not reword plan names.
Do not change numbers.

Layout rules:
- Desktop: 3-column grid (if 3 plans), or 2-column if fewer
- Mobile: stacked
- Each plan is a calm card:
  - subtle border
  - rounded-2xl
  - no shadows
  - no badges like “Best value”

Each plan card contains:
- Plan name
- Short description (1 line)
- Price (or “Contact sales”)
- Billing unit (e.g. per month, per org, usage-based)
- Primary CTA:
  - “Book a demo” or “Contact sales”
- Optional secondary link:
  - “View details”

Do NOT:
- Add comparison checkmarks inside the cards
- Add artificial limits unless they exist today

============================================================
SECTION 3 — WHAT’S INCLUDED (ALL PLANS)

Title:
What’s included with CloudVerse

Grid (2–3 columns):

Rules:
- Short labels only (no paragraphs)

- This section reassures buyers they’re not “missing basics”

============================================================

============================================================
SECTION 6 — FAQ (SHORT, PRACTICAL)

Questions + answers (locked):

1) How is pricing calculated?
Pricing is based on usage and environment complexity. We’ll review this with you during onboarding.

2) Do you support multi-cloud pricing?
Yes—pricing supports environments spanning multiple clouds and platforms.

3) Are there limits on accounts or teams?
CloudVerse is designed for enterprise scale. Limits, if any, depend on plan and usage.

4) Can we start small and scale?
Yes—most customers start with visibility and expand into automation.

5) Is support included?
Standard support is included. Advanced support options are available.

Use accordion or stacked layout. Keep answers short.

============================================================
SECTION 7 — FINAL CTA

Title:
See CloudVerse on your data.

Body:
We’ll walk through your environment and recommend the right plan.

Buttons:
Primary: Book a demo
Secondary: Contact sales

Centered. Calm. No extra copy.

============================================================
SPACING & STYLE RULES (CRITICAL)
- Remove excessive whitespace:
  - Replace py-24 / py-32 with py-cv-sec-lg
  - Replace gap-24 with gap-12
- Keep max paragraph width ~60–65ch
- No gradients
- No loud highlights
- Match Home + Platform typography exactly

============================================================
GUARDRAILS
- Do NOT invent pricing details
- Do NOT add “free”, “trial”, or discounts unless they exist today
- Do NOT add marketing fluff
- Treat this page as LOCKED after completion

============================================================
DELIVERABLE
- /pricing page is enterprise-grade and trustworthy
- Numbers match existing CloudVerse site exactly
- Page feels calm, clear, and scalable
- Better than Vantage/Datadog because it avoids noise and ambiguity
