We are FINALIZING and LOCKING the SECURITY page.
Route: /security

Goal:
- Simple, enterprise-trustworthy
- No fluff, no fear language
- No fake claims
- Calm AIX/Apple aesthetic
- Tight spacing (no huge empty sections)

DO NOT modify Home, Platform, Solutions, Integrations, Pricing, or nav/footer.
Only edit the Security page and any components used exclusively by /security.

============================================================
BRANDING & TITLE
- document.title = "Security — CloudVerse™"
- Use “CloudVerse™” only in the page title and first heading.
- Elsewhere use “CloudVerse”.

============================================================
PAGE STRUCTURE (LOCKED)
1) Hero
2) Security principles (3 items)
3) Core controls (2-column list)
4) Compliance alignment (quiet)
5) Data handling & privacy (short)
6) Contact CTA

No additional sections.

============================================================
SECTION 1 — HERO
Eyebrow:
Security

H1:
Security and compliance, built in.

Subhead (1 sentence):
CloudVerse is designed for enterprise environments—from access control to auditability.

Optional tiny line (muted, NOT a claim of certification unless true):
“ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II alignment.”

Layout:
- Centered
- max-w-[760px]
- py-cv-sec-lg

============================================================
SECTION 2 — PRINCIPLES (3 ITEMS)
Title:
Designed for enterprise trust.

Items (copy locked):
1) Least-privilege by default
Connections are scoped and read-only wherever possible.
2) Auditable actions
Syncs and automation paths are logged for review.
3) Data minimization
Only the signals needed for reporting and automation are collected.

Style:
- 3 columns desktop, stack on mobile
- typography-first, subtle border, no icons required
- py-cv-sec-md

============================================================
SECTION 3 — CORE CONTROLS (2-COLUMN)
Title:
Core security controls

Build a clean 2-column list (no cards; just grouped rows with dividers).
Each row: Control name (left) + one-line description (right).

Controls (copy locked):
- SSO and identity: Supports enterprise SSO and directory-based access patterns.
- Role-based access: Fine-grained permissions by org, workspace, and team.
- Scoped integrations: Read-only, least-privilege access to billing and usage wherever possible.
- Audit logs: Track sync activity, configuration changes, and automation actions.
- Data encryption: Encryption in transit and at rest.
- Tenant isolation: Multi-tenant boundaries by organization.
- Secure automation: Guardrails and approvals for safe actions.
- Export controls: Controlled export for reports and billing data.

Spacing:
- Tight, Apple settings feel
- Use subtle dividers (border-white/10)
- py-cv-sec-lg

============================================================
SECTION 4 — COMPLIANCE ALIGNMENT (QUIET)
Title:
Compliance alignment

Body:
CloudVerse is built to support common enterprise security reviews and compliance requirements.

Badges / pills (no big logos):
- ISO 27001
- SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR-ready

NOTE:
Do NOT claim certification unless true.
If not certified, phrase as “aligned with” (not “certified”).

============================================================
SECTION 5 — DATA HANDLING & PRIVACY (SHORT)
Title:
Data handling

Bullets:
- Billing and usage signals are ingested to power reporting and automation.
- Access is scoped and designed to be read-only wherever possible.
- Customers control who can view, export, and act on data.

Keep this short; no legal policy page here.

============================================================
SECTION 6 — CTA
Title:
Need a security review?
Body:
We can share security documentation and answer vendor questionnaires.
Buttons:
Primary: Contact sales
Secondary: Book a demo

Centered, minimal, py-cv-sec-lg.

============================================================
SPACING & STYLE RULES
- Replace py-24/py-32 with py-cv-sec-lg
- Keep max widths consistent with Home/Platform
- No gradients, no big images
- Calm typography, settings-like sections

============================================================
DELIVERABLE
- /security page is enterprise-grade, minimal, and trustworthy
- No exaggerated claims
- Matches the rest of the site’s premium aesthetic
- Treat as LOCKED after completion
