On /solutions, replace the right-side skeleton panels with contextual micro-copy panels.
DO NOT change the left-side Solutions copy.
DO NOT change other pages.

Goal: AIX/Apple-style subtle “preview” panels that balance the layout and add clarity, without looking like marketing captions.

------------------------------------------------------------
PANEL DESIGN (USED FOR ALL 3 ROLES)
Create a reusable component for the right-side panel, e.g. <SolutionPreviewPanel />.

Styling:
- rounded-2xl
- border (border-white/10 on dark)
- bg-white/5 (subtle)
- padding: p-6 md:p-8
- no shadows, no gradients
- no icons
- no charts
- no fake numbers
- no long text

Typography inside panel:
- Eyebrow: text-xs uppercase tracking-widest text-muted
- Title: text-lg font-semibold
- Lines: text-sm text-muted, space-y-2

Add a very subtle “preview” structure below the lines:
- a minimal list or grid of 4–6 neutral rows (no labels like “CPU”, “Cost”, etc.)
- use subtle dividers (border-white/10)
- keep it abstract, like a UI outline

------------------------------------------------------------
FINANCE PANEL COPY (RIGHT SIDE)
Eyebrow:
FINANCE VIEW
Title:
Close with confidence
Lines:
- Allocation-ready views
- Audit-friendly exports
- Savings tracked as realized

------------------------------------------------------------
ENGINEERING PANEL COPY (RIGHT SIDE)
Eyebrow:
ENGINEERING VIEW
Title:
Cost context before it ships
Lines:
- Service + environment signals
- Actionable recommendations
- Clear ownership mapping

------------------------------------------------------------
IT / PLATFORM PANEL COPY (RIGHT SIDE)
Eyebrow:
PLATFORM VIEW
Title:
Governance at scale
Lines:
- Normalized dimensions
- Guardrails for safe automation
- Access controls + auditability

------------------------------------------------------------
LAYOUT RULES (KEEP)
- Keep the 2-column layout for each role section
- Alternate alignment:
  Finance: text left, panel right
  Engineering: panel left, text right
  IT: text left, panel right
- Ensure the panel occupies the right column fully (no tiny box)
- Reduce empty black space

------------------------------------------------------------
DELIVERABLE
- /solutions right-side panels are now contextual micro-copy panels
- Premium, subtle, AIX-style
- No screenshots, no fake charts, no extra marketing
- Layout feels balanced across wide screens
