You are working in the CloudVerse Website repo (Next.js + Tailwind). Refactor ONLY the Home page (/app/page.tsx or the current Home route) and any shared layout components it uses (Header/Nav, Footer, small UI components). Keep the global design language consistent with the existing site (dark, premium, calm). DO NOT change other pages except shared header/footer if required for consistency.

GOALS
1) Replace the current Home page content with the exact locked structure + copy below.
2) Make the layout fully responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop) and visually balanced at all viewport widths.
3) Implement a subtle motion hero background (animated gradient + faint grid) that is tasteful and low-motion:
   - Use CSS + Tailwind (no heavy canvas).
   - Respect prefers-reduced-motion.
4) Build “What CloudVerse Offers” as 6 premium pillar cards (3x2 desktop, 2x tablet, 1x mobile) using the visual spec below.
5) Improve the “How CloudVerse works” section to be premium:
   - 3 step cards with mini “setup preview” chips (not empty boxes).
   - Clean typography, consistent spacing, and subtle hover states.
6) Ensure Header is aligned to the same container width as page content and menu text has enough contrast to be readable.
7) Wire all nav/menu buttons and CTAs to routes:
   - Platform -> /platform
   - Solutions -> /solutions
   - Integrations -> /integrations
   - Security -> /security
   - Resources -> /resources
   - Pricing -> /pricing
   - Sign in -> /signin (or existing auth route)
   - Book a demo -> /book-demo (or existing demo route; if none, create /book-demo as a simple page with a heading + Calendly placeholder link area)
   - Contact sales -> /contact (create if missing; simple page with contact copy + mailto placeholder)
   - Watch 90-second tour -> /tour (create a page with an embedded placeholder video component and “Coming soon”)
8) Do NOT add “Company” to the top nav. Keep company-related links only in the footer.
9) Footer:
   - Keep existing columns but ensure links match available routes; create placeholder pages if missing (Blog, Documentation, API Reference, Status, Legal, Privacy, Terms).
   - Styling should match the new home page spacing and container width.
10) Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary.

HOME PAGE STRUCTURE + EXACT COPY (use exactly)
HEADER NAV:
Platform, Solutions, Integrations, Security, Resources, Pricing, Sign in, Book a demo (button), theme toggle icon.

HERO:
Headline: “Cloud financial management for modern enterprises.”
Subhead: “Unified visibility, allocation, anomalies, and automated optimization across cloud, data, and AI platforms.”
Support line: “Private deployment and air-gapped options available for regulated environments.”
CTAs: Primary “Book a demo”, Secondary “Watch 90-second tour →”
Optional small caption under CTAs: “Trusted by FinOps and platform teams at leading enterprises.”

LOGO STRIP:
Heading: “Used by FinOps teams at leading enterprises.”
Render the existing logos (Dr. Reddy’s, Infogain, Axis Max Life, Shaw, SISL, etc.) with correct spacing:
- Equal vertical alignment
- Opacity ~80% with hover to 100%
- Responsive wrap on mobile

SECTION: WHAT CLOUDVERSE OFFERS
Eyebrow: “WHAT CLOUDVERSE OFFERS”
Headline: “Everything you need to manage cloud, data, and AI spend — in one platform.”
Subhead: “Built for enterprise scale, multi-tenant governance, and measurable outcomes.”
Six pillar cards (title + one sentence):
1) Multi-cloud FinOps — “Unified cost visibility, allocation, chargeback, and optimization across major clouds and regions.”
2) BillOps (Billing Intelligence) — “Invoice validation, margin insights, anomaly alerts, and dispute prevention for resellers and enterprises.”
3) Tagging & Cost Normalization — “Automated tag governance and normalized dimensions that make allocation and reporting consistent.”
4) Developer FinOps (Shift-left) — “Cost context where engineers work — services, environments, pipelines, and workloads.”
5) AI & GPU Workload Optimization — “Optimize GPUs and LLM usage across training and inference with smarter placement and routing.”
6) ML-driven Optimization & Anomalies — “Detect anomalies early, predict risk, and automate savings actions with guardrails and tracking.”
Under cards small line with link: “Explore the platform →” (to /platform)

SECTION: HOW CLOUDVERSE WORKS
Headline: “How CloudVerse works”
Subhead: “Connect once. Normalize everything. Automate what you can.”
Step cards:
Connect:
Body: “Read-only connections across cloud, data, and AI platforms.”
Bullets:
- “Scoped access and tenant isolation”
- “Imports billing + usage signals”
- “Fast onboarding with guided setup”
Normalize:
Body: “A unified cost model for accounts, tags, owners, services, and products.”
Bullets:
- “Tag normalization + governance”
- “Allocation-ready dimensions”
- “Consistent reporting across platforms”
Automate:
Body: “Recommendations and actions driven by ML models, with guardrails.”
Bullets:
- “Detect + predict anomalies”
- “Apply safe actions with approvals”
- “Track realized savings”
Mini link: “Explore Platform →” (to /platform)

SECTION: OUTCOMES
Headline: “A single platform for visibility, accountability, and action.”
Four outcome tiles:
Visibility — “Unified, real-time cost views across clouds, data, and AI workloads.”
Allocation — “Audit-ready showback and chargeback across teams, products, and business units.”
Anomalies — “Detect and predict spend spikes before impact — with alerting and context.”
Automation — “ML-driven recommendations and guardrailed actions with realized savings tracking.”

SECTION: SECURITY & DEPLOYMENT
Headline: “Security and compliance, built in.”
Subhead: “Designed for enterprise environments — from access control to auditability.”
Body: “Private deployment options — including air-gapped environments — available for regulated enterprises.”
Small line: “ISO 27001 • SOC 2 Type II” (use exact text)

FINAL CTA:
Headline: “See CloudVerse on your data.”
Subhead: “We’ll map your spend structure and the fastest path to measurable savings.”
CTAs: “Book a demo” (primary) and “Contact sales” (secondary)

VISUAL SPEC FOR PILLAR CARDS
- Grid: 3 cols desktop, 2 cols tablet, 1 col mobile
- Card: radius 24, subtle border, soft shadow, gradient bg, hover lift
- Icon + title row, one sentence body, optional “Learn more →” (subtle)
- Use lucide-react icons: Globe, Receipt/FileText, Tag, Code2, Cpu/Brain, Activity/Radar

RESPONSIVE REQUIREMENTS
- Use a consistent max-width container for header + sections (e.g., max-w-6xl/7xl).
- Avoid cramped hero: ensure adequate vertical padding and spacing between text and the right-side hero visual (if present).
- Mobile: stack hero, center CTAs, reduce headline size gracefully, logos wrap, sections remain readable.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- If any routes referenced do not exist, create minimal placeholder pages with the correct heading and a short paragraph.
- Keep code clean: extract small components (PillarCard, StepCard, OutcomeTile, MotionHeroBackground) into /components as needed.
- Ensure prefers-reduced-motion disables hero animation.
- Run typecheck/build and fix any issues.

DELIVERABLE
Commit the refactor with clean components and no layout regressions. The Home page must look premium on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
